# Base_Converter

Program uses stacks to take 3 non-negative (base 10) long integer numbers and a base B (B is in range 2-9) and writes the number to the screen as a base B number.

ListStackDataStrucClass has private inner class called StackNode. BaseConverter has private inner class called BaseNumber.

Test data is hardcoded into the demo program to test for:

a) 72 (base 10 -> base 4)
b) 53 (base 10 -> base 2)
c) 3553 (base 10 -> base 8)
